This repository contains code, demos, and tools created by Jmaxxz and presented
at Defcon 24 for the purposes of interacting with the August lock ecosystem. This
repository lacks the polish one would expect to find on an actual SDK as it was
developed primarly to research the security of August devices. However, it is a
good starting place for building additional tools or apps which need to interact
with an August device.
